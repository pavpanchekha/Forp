* Performance
Currently, we're seeing a 117% overhead over Python. This is good,
because this means that a rewrite into, say, Haskell or Go or D will
likely result in an acceptable, Python-order runtime. Perhaps even
faster-than-python given the cleaner semantics of Forp. Or, perhaps
slower due to the reliance on multimethods. Who knows!
