The Forp Programming Language
=============================

Forp is a new programming language whose goal is to maximize program
maintainability and readability. Forp is a language that struggles to
create readable programs that are understandable with as little
background as possible, from a simple syntax to providing powerful
abstractions to allow common patterns to be encapsulated into easy to
describe units.

Forp also maintains a focus on *informality, simplicity, and
dynamicity*. Forp is Lisp- and Python-inspired --- in particular, the
core is Lispish, the syntax is highly Pythonic, and the ideas are a meld
of the two.
